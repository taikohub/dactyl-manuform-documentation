# 5. Hot Swapping Keyswitches

5.1 Necessary tools and components

* Keyswitches: **5-legged MX style keyswitches** are recommended. MX Cherry and Gaterons are officially supported. But it should work with most MX style switches.
* Keyswitch puller
* Keycap puller

{% hint style="warning" %}
Not compatible with Kailh switches and low profile switches.

Hotswap a single keyswitch at a time to avoid any issues.
{% endhint %}



5.3 Summary

1. Remove all the keycaps with the keycap puller.
2. Remove a single keyswitch at a time. Pull out the keyswitch with a keyswitch puller, it should not take a lot of force. If the keyswitch is not coming out, try orienting it from a different angle.
3. &#x20;Insert the new keyswitch.

5.4.1. Align the metal pins on the keyswitch

* The orange arrows in Figure 5.1 point to where I prefer to hold the keyswitch while aligning it.
* In order for the keyswitch to make an electrical connection with the PCB, the metal pins on the keyswitch seen in Figure 5.2 needs to slide between the two metal foils in the hotswap socket seen in Figure 5.3
* The purple arrow in Figure 5.2 points at the thinner, more flexible, metal pin on the keyswitch. This pin is harder to align. If this is aligned, the other stiffer metal pin is generally not a problem.&#x20;



2\. Wiggle the keyswitch

* To get a sense of whether the metal pins have inserted into the metal foils of the hotswap socket, slightly wiggle the keyswitch before fully inserting it. If it feels like the metal pin doesn't easily move, then it's likely inserted between the metal foils. Then push the keyswitch all the way in.

This is because the PCB is stabilized by the keyswitches. Removing one keyswitch at a time will minimize movement of the PCB and avoid any needless hassle later on.
