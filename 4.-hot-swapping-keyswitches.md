# 5. Hot Swapping Keyswitches

5.1 Necessary tools and components

* Keyswitches: **5-legged MX style keyswitches** are recommended. MX Cherry and Gaterons are officially supported. But it should work with most MX style switches.
* Keyswitch puller
* Keycap puller

{% hint style="warning" %}
Not compatible with Kailh switches and low profile switches.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Hotswap a single keyswitch at a time to avoid any issues.

The PCB is stabilized by the keyswitches. Removing one keyswitch at a time will minimize movement of the PCB and avoid any hassle. Removing 2 or 3 keyswitches at a time shouldn't cause any issues, but please don't remove every keyswitch all at once.
{% endhint %}



5.3 Summary

1. Remove all the keycaps with the keycap puller.
2. Remove a single keyswitch at a time.
3. Pull out the keyswitch with a keyswitch puller, it should not take a lot of force. If the keyswitch is not coming out, try orienting it from a different angle.
4. &#x20;Insert the new keyswitch.



5.4 Tips

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Align the keyswitch metal pins" %}
* In order for the keyswitch to make an electrical connection with the PCB, the metal pins on the keyswitch seen in Figure 5.1 needs to slide between the two metal foils in the hotswap socket seen in Figure 5.2A.
* The purple arrow in Figure 5.2.A and Figure 5.2.B points to the thinner, more flexible, metal pin on the keyswitch. This pin is harder to align. If this is aligned, the other stiffer metal pin is generally not a problem.&#x20;

{% tab title="Wiggle the keyswitch" %}
* The orange arrows in Figure 5.3 point to where I prefer to hold the keyswitch while aligning it.
* To get a sense of whether the metal pins have inserted into the metal foils of the hotswap socket, slightly wiggle the keyswitch in the direction indicated by the two orange arrows before fully inserting it.&#x20;
* If it feels like the metal pin doesn't easily move, then it's likely inserted between the metal foils. Then push the keyswitch all the way in.
