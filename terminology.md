# 9. Terminology

9.1 Keycode: The output after you press the key. For example, "Q" or "F11".

9.2 Keymapping: Your custom keyboard layout. For example, QWERTY or DVORAK.

9.3 Layers:  Layers are a QMK specific functionality. The concept is similar to a Fn or FnLock key that is seen on some keyboards.

9.4 Layer Key: The keycode you use to switch to a different layer. If you are using the QMK Configurator web tool, you'll see M(0) or M(1). If you follow section 4, you'll see RAISE and LOWER in the default dactyl\_manuform/5x6 keymapping.
