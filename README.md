# 1. Introduction

Thank you for purchasing a dactyl manuform keyboard. This user guide will be continuously updated. If you have any questions, please email me anytime at david@taikohub.com. I will try to get back to you as soon as I can.

Please make sure you selected the correct keyboard version on the left. Version refers to the date of shipment. For example, Version 2021-06-24 refers to any keyboard shipped from 2021-06-24 to 2021-09-11. Version 2022-01-10, the most current version, refers to any keyboards shipped after 2022-07-01.



1.1 Getting started

Your keyboard should work without any configurations. Simply plug in the USB cord to the left side of the keyboard. Your keyboard comes pre-flashed with the default keyboard layout seen in sections 1.1 to 1.3 below.

The rest of the documentation discusses how to customize the keyboard.

The MO(1) and MO(2) keys seen in the keyboard layouts in section 1.2 below are also known as LOWER and RAISE keys. These function similar to a SHIFT key on a regular keyboard.
