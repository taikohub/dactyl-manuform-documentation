# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 WelcomeðŸ‘‹

Thank you for purchasing a dactyl manuform keyboard. This user guide will be continuously updated. If you have any questions, please email me anytime at david@taikohub.com. I will try to get back to you as soon as I can.

Please make sure you selected the correct keyboard version on the left. Version refers to the date of shipment. For example, Version 2021-06-24 refers to any keyboard shipped from 2021-06-24 to 2021-09-11. Version 2022-07-01, the most current version, refers to any keyboards shipped after 2022-07-01.

If you are confused about anything or have suggestions on how to improve the documentation, please share it in the GitHub discussions page [here](https://github.com/taikohub/dactyl-manuform-documentation/discussions/categories/general).



## 1.2 Getting started

1. Your keyboard should work without any configurations.&#x20;
2. Plug in the USB cord to the **left side** of the keyboard.&#x20;
3. Your keyboard comes pre-flashed with the default keyboard layout seen in sections 1.1 to 1.3 below.
4. The rest of the documentation discusses how to customize the keyboard.



## 1.3 Keyboard layout

{% hint style="info" %}
The MO(1) and MO(2) keys seen in the keyboard layouts in section 1.2 below are also known as LOWER and RAISE keys. These function similar to a SHIFT key on a regular keyboard.
{% endhint %}



#### 1.3.1 Default keyboard layout for size large (6 keyed thumb cluster)
