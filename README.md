# 1. Introduction

Thank you for purchasing a dactyl manuform keyboard. This user guide will be continuously updated. If you have any questions, please email me anytime at david@taikohub.com. I will try to get back to you as soon as I can.

Please make sure you selected the correct keyboard version on the left. Version refers to the date of shipment. For example, Version 2021-06-24 refers to any keyboard shipped from 2021-06-24 to 2021-09-11. Version 2022-01-10, the most current version, refers to any keyboards shipped after 2022-07-01.



1.1 Getting started

Your keyboard should work without any configurations. Simply plug in the USB cord to the left side of the keyboard. Your keyboard comes pre-flashed with the default keymap seen in sections 1.1 to 1.3 below.

The rest of the documentation discusses how to customize the keyboard.
